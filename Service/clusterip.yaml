  # In the backend the service is using Endpoints to route the traffic to the pods
  # ClusterIP is the default type
  # ClusterIP: Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the service only reachable from within the cluster.
  # <svc-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local  # DNS name of the service in the cluster
  # NodePort: Exposes the service on each Nodeâ€™s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP service, to which the NodePort service will route, is automatically created.
