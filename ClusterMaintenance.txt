# Points to be used before upgrade

1. kubectl drain node-1
# This will evict all the pods from the node-1 and make it unschedulable
# Pods which are not managed by a controller will be deleted 
# Pods which are managed by a controller will be rescheduled to other nodes
2. kubectl cordon node-1
# This will make the node-1 unschedulable but will not evict the pods

3. kubectl uncordon node-1
# This will make the node-1 schedulable again after the upgrade
